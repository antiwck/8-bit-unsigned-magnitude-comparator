# 8-bit-unsigned-magnitude-comparator
# The 8-bit unsigned magnitude comparator uses full adders to create a 4-bit comparator which can be cascaded to perform comparison of 8-bits, 16-bits and so on unsigned binary numbers.

The program is compiled in Intel Quartus Prime and run under the testbench to perform the functional computation.
The 8-bit unsigned magnitude comparator takes two 8-bit number in binary and compare the two.
The comparator consists of two cascaded 4-bit comparators that is made up of four full adders.
